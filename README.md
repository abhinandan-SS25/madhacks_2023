# Bark Buddy

Our project is called **Bark Buddy**. It is a website dedicated to dogs and their owners. It connects dogs with each other based on proximity and interests. The website also allows dog owners to check out popular dog walking trails near them.

Bark Buddy truly is a paw-radise for man and dog alike.
